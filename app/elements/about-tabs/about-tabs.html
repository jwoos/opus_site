		           				<p>As a student this is something we say all too often. We can't devote our time to working a job as our extracurriculars interfere. But if we were to drop our extracurriculars, our college applications won't look as good. </p>
	           					<p>We don't have any money, or even any idea about what we might want to do in the future.</p>
	           					<p>Our lives aren't easy as some people may think: we're expected to balance a social life, academics, extracurriculars and professional experience. As students ourselves, we understand thoroughly the problem we all face. That's why we came up with OPUS.</p>

		           				<p>When workers go on vacation or are out sick it only affects the business's productivity negatively. Also during periods of times during which the workload is heavy, not having enough workers is a huge limiting factor.</p>
		           				<p>The next time this happens instead of tearing your hair out, try OPUS. You'll  be helping out high school students while maintaining your productivty: beneficial for everyone involved.</p>
